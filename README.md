## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Conda (for environment management)
- Git LFS (Large File Storage) -- For IsaacLab
- CMake -- For IsaacLab

And the following system packages:
```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3 libgl1-mesa-glx libosmesa6 git-lfs cmake
```

## üìñ Installation

This project requires different Conda environments for different sets of experiments.

### Common Setup
First, ensure the common dependencies are installed as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

### Environment for HumanoidBench

```bash
conda create -n tdmc_td3_hb -y python=3.10
conda activate tdmc_td3_hb
pip install --editable git+https://github.com/carlosferrazza/humanoid-bench.git#egg=humanoid-bench
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

### Environment for MuJoCo Playground
```bash
conda create -n tdmc_td3_playground -y python=3.10
conda activate tdmc_td3_playground
pip install -r requirements/requirements_playground.txt
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Our `requirements_playground.txt` specifies `Jax==0.4.35`, which we found to be stable for latest GPUs in certain tasks such as `LeapCubeReorient` or `LeapCubeRotateZAxis`


### Environment for IsaacLab
```bash
conda create -n tdmc_td3_isaaclab -y python=3.10
conda activate tdmc_td3_isaaclab

# Install IsaacLab (refer to official documentation for the latest steps)
# Official Quickstart: https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/quickstart.html
pip install 'isaacsim[all,extscache]==4.5.0' --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git
cd IsaacLab
./isaaclab.sh --install
cd ..

# Install project-specific requirements
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

### Environment for MTBench
MTBench does not support humanoid experiments, but is a useful multi-task benchmark with massive parallel simulation. This could be useful for users who want to use tdmc_td3 for their multi-task experiments.

```bash
conda create -n tdmc_td3_mtbench -y python=3.8  # Note python version
conda activate tdmc_td3_mtbench

# Install IsaacGym -- recommend to follow instructions in https://github.com/BoosterRobotics/booster_gym
...

# Install MTBench
git clone https://github.com/Viraj-Joshi/MTBench.git
cd MTbench
pip install -e .
pip install skrl
cd ..

# Install project-specific requirements
pip install -r requirements/requirements_isaacgym.txt
```

## üöÄ Running Experiments

Activate the appropriate Conda environment before running experiments.

Please see `tdmc_td3_td3/hyperparams.py` for information regarding hyperparameters!
